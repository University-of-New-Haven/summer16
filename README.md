## Syllabus

Below is the formal syllabus explaining what the course exactly is but these tend to get a little jargony at times which won't be incredibly helpful if there is your first introduction into the course. The short of it is this: This course is _outcomes_ centric and thus you will learn by _doing_. While the first part of the course is focused on understanding design techniques and terminology and is a little more content driven, we will be simply applying this foundational knowledge through different use cases throughout the rest of the semester. The real work are the assignments in which you'll be creating tangible publication pieces. You'll then be putting these works onto your blog where you'll be expected to reflect on your work and give a narrative for your creative process. In the end, you'll have a robust portfolio (so to speak) which won't only be a collection of your final work which potential employers can see, but a collection of your thoughts, struggles, and victories throughout this 16-week experience. In essence, you'll be donning a potentially new hat of "Visual Designer" throughout this exploration. You'll also be a "Digital Storyteller." Terms like "digital," "visual," or "creative" can seem a little scary to some, but that's ok right now. Like a good ride at a theme park, a little bit of nervousness makes the ride much more memorable on the back end. Note that most of you are coming in at the same level: novice. This means you all are your biggest allies. I _want _you to be successful in this course and to do this you will see that I've set up ways in which you can lean on and learn from each other's experiences throughout the course.

### Course Description

Institutional and industrial publications as an important means of internal and external communications with special emphasis on design, layout and content. Laboratory. **Prerequisites**: JMC 1013, 2033, 3413, and 3423.

### Course Objectives

Think **critically, creatively and independently**. Recognize how public relations publications differ from other publications in purpose, publics, funding and design. Apply **graphic design concepts** and apply appropriate visual communication theories in the effective use and presentation of images and information. Apply **web design concepts** and apply web communication techniques and theories in the effective use and presentation of images and information online. **Conduct research**, evaluate information and use that knowledge to select appropriate communication channel. Design for a target audience. Distinguish and demonstrate the **use a variety of publication production techniques** and options.

### Course Outcomes

Students will launch and maintain a blog as well as comment on the blogs of their peers. Students will build a foundational knowledge of the landscape of visual communication technologies. Students will design a business card and letterhead for a brand. Students will design a direct mail piece for multiple, specific publics. Students will design a newsletter for an entity. Students will develop a personal portfolio website.

### Course Rationale

This course strives to train students to recognize and apply good publication design techniques in a public relations setting. In addition, students will learn the importance of structuring visual communications for the web. The major goal of the course is to give students the ability to translate a concept of visual communication into an actual publication. Other goals include practice with computer graphics, knowledge of publication techniques and options in print and online, publication production skills and a knowledge of how to work with designers, graphic artists, publication specialists, photographers and commercial printers and web developers to convey their messages to target audiences.

### Assignments / Grading

This course has a mix of Design projects assignments and weekly assignments. Weekly assignments will included course readings, watching tutorial videos, writing blog posts, and comment on other student's blogs. There will be eight (8) quizzes throughout the summer semester and they are worth 20 points. This one is fairly straight forward: you do what is asked and you will complete an online quiz about those assignments. You will self assess how much of the work you did each week through the unit quiz.

There will be four projects throughout the summer semester and they are worth 60 points per project. I grade these against a rubric, which you will get at the beginning of each assignment ([click here to view a sample rubric](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ge5xskau54ryb5/rubricsample.pdf?dl=0)). Assignments are expected to be turned in on time. Quizzes are due on Thursdays at noon. I do give a 24-hour grace period for all assignments and will accept work until the following day at noon. Absolutely no assignment will be accepted later than the 24-hour grace period. This is an online class meaning that you have an incredible luxury of being able to work ahead in a lot of cases. My suggestion is to completely take advantage of this and stay ahead of the course schedule. You'll thank me when finals roll around and you've got this class out of the way!

### Toolbox

*   **Blog** - As mentioned earlier, one of your assignments will be building and maintaining a personal blog with the platform of your choice. There's more information about how to technically set this up in Week 1.
*   **Course Website** - If you are reading this, you're on the course website! Hooray. Here is where you'll find the majority of course content. Each week has a corresponding module which will tell you what you are expected to do that week. That may include watching videos, reading material, working on a project, a Google Hangout, etc.
*   **Course Hub** - These are where you'll be able to see all the different blog posts from all your peers. This will be helpful in seeing what everyone else is up to. You'll be asked periodically throughout the semester to comment on various posts from other students.
*   **Software** - This course heavily relies on two specific programs for most of the design work you will be doing: Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign. These apps (plus tons of other nice products from Adobe) are [currently available for $19.99](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html?sdid=KKTHX&skwcid=AL!3085!3!57438613702!b!!g!!student%20creative%20cloud%20discount&ef_id=U9qj9AAAAPwLracF:20141203035138:s) as a product called Creative Cloud Complete. My suggestion is that use this service for the semester. While that is not cheap, it's small price to pay have resume line items such as "Adobe Photoshop." That said, I understand that may be out of reach for some. For those close to campus, one option is to utilize the computers in the Gaylord computer labs as they have fully up-to-date versions of both these programs (**Note: If you are going to use the computer lab, remember that the computer wipes your files every time you log out. Make sure you always carry a flash drive or external hard drive with you!**). For others who don't have the luxury of visiting campus and still don't want to splurge on  Adobe Photoshop, graphic design concepts are completely transferable to other (sometimes free) applications. There are even some great options now that are web or tablet based. I've created a page for free alternatives to both of these programs. You can use these, but please proceed with caution knowing that my knowledge is significantly limited to what these programs offer.

### Gaylord Computer Lab

This course focuses heavily on some paid tools that exist in Adobe Creative Suite. If you are located in Norman, you can access all of these programs for free in the Gaylord Computer labs. Your initial login uses your OU NetID (4x4) as your user name, and “changeme” as your password.  You will be prompted to change your password on your first logon Their Gaylord College network login is distinct from your OU Ozone/email login and only applies to the Gaylord College network. You may not share their login information with anyone.  Doing so may result in their losing access to the network. Please log off when finished using a workstation, but never shut down the computers. Please be courteous of the other students who use these spaces by keeping lids on drinks and by being careful with food. Trash and recycling bins are available in all labs and throughout the College.

#### Lab Hours

**GYLD 2150** 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday (Closed on Monday July 4th!)

### Special Needs

Students who need special accommodations or have special needs are invited to share these concerns or requests as soon as possible.  Requests for reasonable accommodation should be addressed to the Disability Resource Center, Goddard Health Center, 620 Elm Avenue, Suite 166, (405) 325-3852, TDD (405) 325-4173, Fax (405) 325-4491 or ods@ou.edu.

## Week 1

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><b>Quiz Due Date</b>: Thursday, May 19, 2016</div>

### Introduction

Howdy! I'm glad you've made it to the course content area for PR Pubs. You'll see a unit for each week of the course similar to this one. In short, each week you will have some course content as well as assignments that you complete (more below on how that is graded). This week is slightly different as we are just easing into the course, so we are going to be spending the week prepping for the rest of the semester by building our toolkit. One thing to know, there is a LOT of things we want to get started this week. With that, things I want you to do:

### 1. Read the syllabus.

It's above. Please read through and make sure everything about the course is clear. If you have any questions, please email me.

### 2. Build your domain / blog

For this class you are required to maintain a domain and blog, which will become a portfolio by the end of the semester. You can use [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), or OU Create (where you could install Wordpress). This choice is totally up to you although there is on campus support for OU Create. Use something you are comfortable with or have a desire to better understand.

### 3. Submit your web address

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10AiBcyHkrtehSh_m2SzYCKDFzKV4KVqYpDiOr0M0LPA/viewform?embedded=true" width="760" height="500" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">Loading...</iframe>

### 4. Write your first post

This activity is designed so that you have a creative way of introducing yourself to the rest of class as well as begin to understand how your blog technically functions. We are going to create a post that I'm going to call a "Professional Portrait." In your blog post, attempt to answer the following questions:

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are you?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you believe?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you do?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What guides you?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What motivates you?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does design fit in your life? </span>

You are required to have at least **one picture** in your post and it's preferable that you take it yourself. Taking this with your smartphone or any camera for that matter is fine. If you don't have access to camera and are on campus, cameras are available for checkout in Gaylord.

### 5. Build your technology toolkit

This is touched on heavily about in the syllabus. Go ahead and get Adobe Creative Cloud installed this week. You can also forgo the expense and use the Gaylord labs but it is recommended that you purchase a subscription, even if it's just for this semester.

### 6. What the heck is a PR Publication?

Alright, now that we've got some of the housekeeping out the way. It's time to get into the content of the course.

Let's start with a good ol' definition:** PR publications** provide a free, controlled media designed for publics who share characteristics and interest. Read that definition again. There's a lot there that's worth unpacking.

#### 1. **PR publications** provide a **free**, controlled media designed for publics who share characteristics and interest.

Who pays? How? Why? Organizational funds support public relations publications to improve or maintain positive relationships with target publics. Some accept advertising, but most do not. Some are partially funded by memberships or subscriptions, but many are not. Usually the organization funds the publication as an operating expense. Usually the beneficial relationships resulting from the communication are worth more to the company than the cost of producing or distributing the publication.

#### 2. PR publications provide a free, **controlled media** designed for publics who share characteristics and interest.

Controlled media? What does that mean? **Controlled media** means that the organization controls the message, when it appears, to whom, and how. Most PR publications are distributed directly to the reader either in-person, by mail, or electronically.

#### 3.  PR publications provide a free, controlled media **designed for publics who share characteristics and interest**.

PR Publications work best when you narrow your public. Know everything you can about the target public of each publication. You want to first learn what motivates your public to actually read the publication and to do this will require you to research your publics (which we will do in one of our next lessons).

#### **Types of PR Publications**

*   Identity Symbols (Logotypes, letterheads). **Identity symbols** combine verbal and visual communications to visually represent the organization.
*   Flat publications (Flyers, posters, etc.) **Flat publications** consist of a single sheet of paper, unfolded, and usually printed on one side.
*   Folded publications (Pamphlets brochures, some newsletters) **Folded publications** use folds to create format.
*   Bound publications (Booklets, magazines, annual reports) **Bound publications** are those containing multiple sheets of paper, held together by binding.

### 7. Design Theory and PR Publications

#### Watch these videos and view these slides.

 First things first. Design is design. The theory and principles do not change whether its interior design, fashion, or landscaping because they are all visual communications. What is different is that every design decision is based on information about the publication's purpose, key message, and target public. Design decisions only work when they consider the effect of the design options on the target public. For most of your career as a PR student, you have focused on writing or verbal communication. You know how to structure verbal communications and how words form sentences which for paragraphs, etc. Effectively understanding writing doesn't happen if it doesn't have that structure to support it. Similarly, **visual communication** uses image and patterns to convey messages (as opposed to language with verbal communication). You'll notice up in the upper right hand corner a set of media. This is a collection of what you are required to watch for the unit. The first video is from Lynda.com and is titled "What makes design great?" and the second is called "Exploring the principles of layout and composition." Check that one out first as its very similar to my in-class presentation. My slides for the in class presentation are below.

 <iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/4zqb4t91QPhDPe" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

[What makes design great?](http://www.lynda.com/course/sharerevideodirect/161817/177322?org=ou.edu)

Please watch the Lynda.com video If you aren't familiar with Lynda.com, it's a service that is newly available for free to the OU community (usually $30 a month!). Lynda.com specializes in a lot of technical tutorials and you can learn everything from Photoshop to programming languages like Ruby on Rails. We won't use it a ton, but more as a starting point of references. Of course, you are more than welcome to watch more videos through the course as you see fit.

[Ira Glass on Being Creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ResTHKVxf4&feature=youtu.be)

Last, you'll find a video from Ira Glass, the host of This American Life. Before we get going too far, I think it's helpful to take a step back and breath again. Remember that creativity and design can be a little hard to grasp at first particularly because your taste is much more refined than your technique. Don't worry about too much about your "products" right now and let's focus on the "process." It's about the _process,_ not the _product_. It's about the _process_, not the _product_. This will slightly change throughout the semester, but, for now, let this be your mantra!

### 8. Complete a design blitz!

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Blog Post Required</div>

Through the presentations above, you've learned about several design concepts:

*   Color
*   Typography
*   Metaphors/symbols
*   Minimalism & use of space
*   Form/function/message
*   Balance
*   Rhythm
*   Proportion
*   Dominance
*   Unity

After reading and reviewing the slides, you should be able to provide a basic explanation of each of these concepts. To reinforce your understanding, I want you to undertake a “Design Blitz”. Carry your camera with you this unit and take photos of objects, ads, signs, etc. that illustrate one of these concepts. When you have completed your Design Blitz, **write a blog post** that embeds the photos and your analysis of the design elements and what makes them effective or not. (You can do this in one single post if you like, or in several.) **Provide an example of at least five of the concepts listed above. Make sure to tag your blog post "Design Blitz.** **PRO TIP:** Sometimes we can learn just as much from badly designed things as we can from well-designed things! So feel free to include bad elements as examples to avoid.

### 9. Typography Games

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Blog Post Required</div>

Typography is a CRITICAL part of how we tell stories. To practice some of our typography skillz (with a emphasized Z!) we are going to play some typography games. For this assignment, you are to choose three of these font games and play them for a little bit. **Write a short blog post about this experience (don't be afraid to include screenshots!). Tag your blog post "Typography."** Of course, you are more than welcome to play all of them if you want.

1. [Shoot the serif.](http://www.tothepoint.co.uk/more/fun/shoot_the_serif/)
This is one of my favorites and if I was to say choose one it would be this one. It helps you practice identifying serif vs sans serif fonts.

2. [Type Connection](http://www.typeconnection.com)
In this game, you'll choose a font as a main character, give them a story, and then find them a partner or love interest. This is a great game for understanding how fonts can take on certain personality types that you can leverage. Have you ever thought a font looked girly? Or formal? Or hipster? How can you take advantage of that if your brand appeals to audiences with similar characteristics?

3. [Poster Letters](http://www.empireonline.com/features/posterletters/)
This is a fun game where you try to guess a movie based off of one letter from the movie title as it appears on its poster. I'll be honest. When I played this game, I expected to do better than I actually did. Bragging rights for the person who gets the most right on this one.

4. [Type War](http://typewar.com)
This is a sort of "this or that" game where you look at a letter and decide what font it is. Want to know how to beat this game? Cheat. I'm dead serious. I think this one worth knowing enough that I would actually recommend you open up a word processing application such as Microsoft Word and literally figure it out before you answer. You'll still learn the different looks of fonts and it will get you a little further. If you can make it through all 10 levels of this game and send me a screenshot, I'll throw in some extra points this week.

5. [Kern Type](http://type.method.ac)
Instructions (from the website): Your mission is simple: achieve pleasant and readable text by distributing the space between letters. Typographers call this activity _kerning_. Your solution will be compared to a typographer's solution, and you will be given a score depending on how close you nailed it. Good luck!

### 10. Finally, take the quiz!

At the end of each unit you will take a quiz on D2L [learn.ou.edu](learn.ou.edu) that is worth a total of 20 points. These exist as a mechanism for you to confirm that you have indeed completed each unit. It isn't actually a "quiz" in the traditional sense of the term. Rather, it's where you tell me that you have indeed completed each portion of the lesson by marking "True" (meaning you did it) or "False" (meaning that you did not do it). Please note: This class, like all the classes at OU, is governed by an Honor Code, which means you must be honest and accurate in the work you do. So, to make sure you are being honest and accurate, read each question differently. When you answer "true," you are taking responsibility for that answer. Wrongly saying you did it, when you indeed did not do it, is a violation of the Honor Code, subject to penalties listed in the **[OU Guide to Academic Integrity](http://onlinecourselady.pbworks.com/w/page/83632159/honorcodeviolations).**

**Push**

Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.

**Remote**

This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

**Repository**

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

**SSH Key**

SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information from GitHub.com to your computer.

**Upstream**

When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the "upstream", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the "downstream".

**User**

Users are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.
